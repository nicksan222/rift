Rift is a CMS that is built to be lightweight and fast.

Rift is built with Go and uses YAML for data storage.
For most use cases that is more than enough.

Rift is also built with a CLI in mind. This means that you can
create, edit, and delete content from the command line, even
on a remote server.

Thanks to Astro's content management system, you can also
have typesafe content.
